# Annotated for Atom ðŸ’Œ

Annotated for Atom is a tool for writing annotated code in [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom). Right now, it's got:

- **Command-`** to insert a code block tagged with your annotated code's language

That's itâ€”it's just a little helper. Things'll be added as they come up.

Use with [Annotated](https://github.com/izuchukwu/annotated). [Tweet me](https://twitter.com/izuchukwuuu) if you need anything.
